# Test Automation challenge

**Author: Matt Rahmani**

This repo contains sample test code for performing verification test on sorting functionality on [Beer Cartel](https://craftcartel.com.au/) website.
The purpose of the test is to verify that sort function is working properly, but the focus on implementing the test is to create a test suite/framework which is:

- Robust
- Readable
- Understandable
- Maintainable

by using POM and Abstraction level techniques.
